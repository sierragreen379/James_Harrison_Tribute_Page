                    <p>James Harrison is a superhero. It's in his blood.</p>
                    <p>Literally.</p>
                    <p>Harrison's blood plasma contains a rare antibody called Anti-D, which is essentially an antidote to hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in unborn children. From this antibody, scientists made a vaccine that has saved over 2.5 million babies' lives.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1936: </strong>Born in Austrailia.</li>
                    <li><strong>1951: </strong>Undergoes major chest surgery that requires a lot of blood. Because of this, he vowed to start donating blood himself once he turned 18 (the then-required age).</li>
                    <li><strong>1954: </strong>Starts donating blood. It only takes a few donations before scientists realize his blood had unusually strong and persistent antibodies to the D Rh group antigen. They then created a vaccine to be used on pregnant mothers to protect their babies from HDN.</li>
                    <li><strong>1954-2018: </strong>Donates blood plasma every three weeks on average.</li>
                    <li><strong>1999: </strong>Awarded the Medal of the Order of Austrailia.</li>
                    <li><strong>2011: </strong>Reaches his 1,000th donation.</li>
                    <li><strong>2018: </strong>Makes his 1,173rd donation, which was also his last, as Australian policy does not allow those past 81 years of age to donate.</li>
                </ul>
